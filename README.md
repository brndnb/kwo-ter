# pen-potter

A simple quote generator web app. Wizardy theme. Clicking on the wizard hat for a second and a half triggers a writing animation and a JS script in the backend taps into a quote generating API. A random number generator is responsible for randomizing the URL and the array of the API object. The data is then appened into the webpage through simple DOM manipulation.
